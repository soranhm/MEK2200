MEK2200 – Continuum Mechanics

## Course content
Then course gives an introduction to continuum mechanics and the mathematical description of forces, stresses and deformations in viscous fluids and elastic materials. The course focuses on the stress tensor, Cauchy’s stress-strain relations, deformations and strain. We study Hooke’s law for elastic matter, Newton’s law of friction in fluids, as well as simple viscoelastic models (stress-strain relations). We consider the derivation of fundamental equations of motion and conservation equations.
